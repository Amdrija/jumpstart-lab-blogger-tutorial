# Blog

This is a blog app made by following [Jumpstart Lab's](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) ruby on rails tutorial. It was done as an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). You can visit this blog at https://secret-forest-19270.herokuapp.com/articles.  
I have never done Ruby on Rails before this tutorial and I'm not sure if it follows all Rails conventions. This website also lacks authentication at the time of writing this README. I will try to update it with new features when I learn a bit more of Ruby and Rails.
